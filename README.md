NMT Retail Sales and Profit Dashboard ðŸ“–

I built this interactive dashboard to help TNMT Retail understand whatâ€™s really going on with their sales and profits across regions, product categories, and sales channels. It takes raw data and turns it into clear insights that actually help guide decisions.

What the Leadership Wanted to Know

In retail, there are always big questions like:

Which products are really selling?

Where are the highest profits coming from?

Are we relying too much on one sales channel?

Before this dashboard, TNMTâ€™s leadership didnâ€™t have a single place to get these answers. They were making decisions based more on gut feeling than data.

What I Did

I designed a dashboard that brings all these pieces together in one place.

At the top, you see the big numbers: Total Sales, Profit, and Margin â€” a quick look at how the business is doing overall.

Thereâ€™s a monthly sales chart that shows trends and helps spot seasonal ups and downs.

An interactive map lets you see which regions are bringing in the most profit.

The product breakdown shows that Decoratives are leading in both sales and profit, while Sports isnâ€™t doing so well.

A pie chart breaks down sales by channeL : Online, In-Store, Distributor, and Wholesale; showing a nice balance, which means the company isnâ€™t putting all its eggs in one basket.

What Stood Out

Decoratives are the star category for both sales and profit

Furniture and Kitchen stuff sell well but donâ€™t make as much profit

Sales dipped noticeably in February, maybe because of seasonality or fewer campaigns

The West region leads in profits, but the South isnâ€™t performing as well. Which gi a chance to rethink strategy there

Sales channels are nicely balanced, which lowers risk

Tools I Used

Power BI and Excel to build and visualize the dashboard

Simple data storytelling to make the numbers easy to understand and act on

Whatâ€™s Next

I want to add sales and profit forecasts so TNMT can plan ahead better.

Adding customer segmentation will give deeper marketing insights.

And automating data updates will keep everything fresh and ready whenever itâ€™s needed.

Why It Matters

This project isnâ€™t just about making charts. Itâ€™s about turning lots of confusing numbers into a story that helps leaders make better, faster decisions. Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m proud of.
