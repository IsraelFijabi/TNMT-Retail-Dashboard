An interactive retail sales and profit dashboard that uncovers key business insights across regions, product categories, and sales channels — turning raw data into actionable strategies for growth.
🛍️ TNMT Retail Sales and Profit Dashboard
📖 Project Story

In today’s competitive retail world, leaders constantly ask:

“Which products drive the most sales?”

“Where are we making the highest profits?”

“Are our sales channels balanced, or are we too dependent on one?”

To answer these questions, I built the TNMT Retail Sales and Profit Dashboard — an interactive report that turns raw sales data into clear, actionable insights.

🎯 The Challenge

TNMT Retail operates across multiple regions, sales channels, and product categories. While sales were strong, leadership lacked a single source of truth to:

Monitor monthly sales performance

Compare regional profitability

Identify top and underperforming product categories

Understand how different sales channels contribute to growth

Without these insights, decision-making was based more on intuition than data.

🛠️ My Approach

I designed a dashboard that connects all these pieces together.

Total Sales, Profit, and Margin are highlighted at the top — giving executives an instant snapshot of business health.

A monthly sales trend chart reveals seasonality and growth patterns.

An interactive map shows profit distribution across regions, allowing for quick geographical comparisons.

Category-level breakdowns highlight that Decoratives dominate sales and profit, while Sports lags behind.

A sales channel pie chart shows balanced performance across Online, In-Store, Distributor, and Wholesale — a sign of a healthy multichannel strategy.

💡 Key Insights

Decoratives is the star category, contributing both the highest sales and the highest profit.

Furniture and Kitchenery are strong contributors but have lower profit margins compared to Decoratives.

Sales are steady, but February shows a noticeable dip, suggesting possible seasonality or campaign gaps.

Regional performance varies — the West leads in profit, while the South underperforms, signaling opportunities for regional strategy shifts.

Sales channels are well-balanced, reducing risk of overdependence on one channel.

📌 Why This Project Matters

This project reflects my ability to not just analyze data, but to tell the story behind the numbers. By building this dashboard, I turned a large, complex dataset into a clear narrative that helps business leaders make smarter, faster decisions.
